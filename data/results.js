                Post: "The first method to invisibility includes the use of mirrors to bend light. Students at <a target='_blank' href='http://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/watch-rochester-cloak-uses-ordinary-lenses-to-hide-objects-across-continuous-range-of-angles-70592/'>Rochester University</a> actually managed to make a \"cloaking device\" from four simple lenses. These lenses bends bends light and sends it through the center of the device, so the on-axis region cannot be blocked or cloaked. Donut shapes created between the lenses in which the object becomes invisible. From this week, we learned that it is possible to fully cloak something in invisibility. These mirrors are adjusted so that change in position/angles will not affect the invisibility) Next week, we'll discuss how we can create our own and the phsyics behind this ending light."

                Post: "What is invisibility? Invisibility is a state in which the object cannot be seen; when this happens, the object becomes transparent so that light can pass through it. Based off this definition, true invisibility would mean that the object/person could freely change between visible/invisible states such that they cannot be seen at all, from any direction, by the naked eye. The closest biological occurrence of invisibility in nature is camouflage. For example, <a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQggDnScsvI'>chameleon</a> and octopi can become very hard to see when camouflaged. Humans try to mimic camouflage with paints and other materials, but we can't efficiently change our appearance. Another form of invisibility includes the use of mirrors. Man-made attempts have included cloaks and buildings. Although they mimic transparency, it only does so at a certain perspective; one person may not see it, but others from different perspectives will be able to see it. This method of invisibility will be discussed next week."
