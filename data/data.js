                Post: "How does light actually work? Light is made up of photons and travels faster than anything in the universe. The <a target='_blank' href='http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/21st_century_science/lectures/lec13.html'>double slit experiment</a> found that light travels in a wavy line with different wavelengths. When these wavelengths are reflected off of objects, our eyes create the different colours that our brains produce. For example, if the room was dark, nothing would be seen in the room because there is no light to reflect off of the objects. In addition to finding out how light travels, we need to know how light reflects off objects. According to the law of reflection, light reflects off a surface at the same angle to the normal. By using this law, we can manipulate light by using a curved surface or rough surface to bend it. The connection between invisibility and light is that invisibility deals with the bending and absorption of light. In order to achieve invisibility, we need to make absorption of invisible object 100% but the object behind the invisible one still reflect light. By finding out how light works, manipulating light becomes easier."

                Post: "The first method to invisibility includes the use of mirrors to bend light. Students at <a target='_blank' href='http://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/watch-rochester-cloak-uses-ordinary-lenses-to-hide-objects-across-continuous-range-of-angles-70592/'>Rochester University</a> actually managed to make a \"cloaking device\" from four simple lenses. These lenses bends bends light and sends it through the center of the device, so the on-axis region cannot be blocked or cloaked. Donut shapes created between the lenses in which the object becomes invisible. From this week, we learned that it is possible to fully cloak something in invisibility. These mirrors are adjusted so that change in position/angles will not affect the invisibility) Next week, we'll discuss how we can create our own and the phsyics behind this ending light."

                Post: "What is invisibility? Invisibility is a state in which the object cannot be seen; when this happens, the object becomes transparent so that light can pass through it. Based off this definition, true invisibility would mean that the object/person could freely change between visible/invisible states such that they cannot be seen at all, from any direction, by the naked eye. The closest biological occurrence of invisibility in nature is camouflage. For example, <a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQggDnScsvI'>chameleon</a> and octopi can become very hard to see when camouflaged. Humans try to mimic camouflage with paints and other materials, but we can't efficiently change our appearance. Another form of invisibility includes the use of mirrors. Man-made attempts have included cloaks and buildings. Although they mimic transparency, it only does so at a certain perspective; one person may not see it, but others from different perspectives will be able to see it. This method of invisibility will be discussed next week."
