Based off of our question and this definition, true invisibility would mean that the object/person could freely change between visible/invisible states such that they cannot be seen at all by the naked eye. Camoflage is the closest biological natural occurrence of invisibility. Humans try to mimic camouflage with paints and other materials, but we can't efficiently change our appearance. Another form of natrual invisbility includes the use of mirrors. Man-made attempts have included cloaks and buildings. Although they mimic transparency, it only does so at a certain perspective; one person may not see it, but others from different perspectives will be able to see it",
